# MASTER-PRODUCTION-SCHEDULE-ITALY-REPORT
📌 Project Overview

The Master Production Schedule (MPS) – Italy Report is a planning and reporting solution designed to provide a time-phased view of production schedules for the Italy organization.

The report helps manufacturing and planning teams align customer demand, production capacity, and manufacturing timelines, ensuring smooth execution of production plans and improved supply chain coordination.

🎯 Business Objective

The key objectives of this report are:

Provide a clear and structured production plan for the Italy organization

Enable alignment between demand forecasts and manufacturing schedules

Improve visibility into planned production quantities and timelines

Support effective decision-making for production and capacity planning

Reduce risks related to overproduction or unmet demand

🧠 Problem Statement

Manufacturing organizations require a reliable and time-phased production plan to:

Meet customer demand on time

Optimize production capacity

Maintain smooth material flow

Without a consolidated MPS, planners may face challenges such as schedule mismatches, capacity overloads, and delayed order fulfillment.
This report addresses these challenges by presenting a structured and organization-specific production schedule.
